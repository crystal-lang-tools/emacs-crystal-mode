;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides error-checking support for the Crystal language to the
;; Flycheck package.  To use it, have Flycheck installed, then add the following
;; to your init file:
;;
;;    (require 'flycheck-crystal)
;;    (add-hook 'crystal-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)

(defun flycheck-crystal--find-default-directory (_checker)
  "Come up with a suitable default directory to run CHECKER in.
This will either be the directory that contains `shard.yml' or,
if no such file is found in the directory hierarchy, the directory
of the current file."
  (or
   (and
    buffer-file-name
    (locate-dominating-file buffer-file-name "shard.yml"))
default-directory))

(flycheck-define-checker crystal-build
  "A Crystal syntax checker using crystal build"
  :command ("crystal"
            "build"
            "--no-codegen"
            "--no-color"
